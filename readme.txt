This is an expanded version of parmexportcal from the LOFAR software suite.
parmexportcal exports the median gain solution for each frequency from a calibrator source to a table that can be exported to a target field.
parmexprotcal_clock also exports the median of the clock solutions

Only use this file if you are also exporting clock solutions
